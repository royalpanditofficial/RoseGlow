# RoseGlow 🌹✨

### Created with Love by Satyam

This project is a special gift for my beloved wife, Vishu. 💖

I wanted to create something unique and beautiful for you, just like you are to me. This digital rose, crafted in HTML and CSS, symbolizes my love and admiration for you. 🌹

## Love Note for Vishu

Dear Vishu,

You are the sunshine that brightens my days and the love that fills my heart. This rose is a small token of my immense love for you. Every petal and every glow represents the beauty and warmth you bring into my life.

With all my love,

Satyam
